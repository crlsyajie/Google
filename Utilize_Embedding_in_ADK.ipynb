        "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate the Agent Development Kit (ADK) with Gemini Embeddings for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Initialize Gemini Embedding:** The `client.models.embed_content` function is used with the `gemini-embedding-001` model to generate embeddings for a collection of documents. This turns human-readable text into dense vector representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **FAISS Indexing:** These document embeddings are then used to create a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index. FAISS is an efficient library for similarity search, allowing for fast retrieval of relevant documents based on their vector representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **ADK Agent with Tool:** An `LlmAgent` from ADK is created, configured to use a Gemini model (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash`). A custom tool, `faiss_search`, is provided to this agent. This tool takes a user query, embeds it using Gemini, searches the FAISS index for similar documents, and returns the retrieved text.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Instruction-based Retrieval:** The ADK agent is given an instruction: \"If the user asks a question that requires knowledge about large language models, vector databases, or AI development, use the 'faiss_search' tool...\" This enables the agent to intelligently decide when to use the `faiss_search` tool to augment its responses with external knowledge, effectively implementing a RAG pattern."
